          <h2>The Riley School Identity</h2>
          <h5>Outreach & Marketing Coordinator, The Riley School</h5>

          <p>The Riley School is a small independent private school on the coast of Rockport, Maine. As their Outreach and Marketing Coordinator &mdash; and in-house design department &mdash; I developed a new brand language and identity and created
            assets for
            future outreach. The objectives for this project were to bring in new enrollment, market the campus and school theater as event spaces, and facilitate communication with currently enrolled families. </p>
          <h5>Design Language</h5>
          <p>My first decision was to create a design language and identity for the school. Because the number of staff and volunteers who would eventually be running the school's advertising, reuseable designs would allow for the variety and
            quantity of materials they release to remain consistent across print and web ads to in-school mailers. To do so, I met with key stakeholders to align on a single brand color and logo and removed old versions, colors, and fonts from the
            existing design materials. </p>
          <p>

          <h5>Website</h5>
          <p>I then prioritized the school's most visible marketing opportunity, the outdated
            website, and rebuilt it with the new branding in Squarespace. We chose to use this platform because it would allow staff of varying technical ability to update and maintain the site without compromising the design or brand integrity. In
            addition to the updated branding, I implemented an easy-to-find contact form with inquiry instructions, which the old site lacked. With a more versatile platform under us, I established a more cohesive color story and matched new free
            fonts to our existing logo. I brought over a great deal of original content from the old site to retain the spirit and history of the school, and I rewrote copy as needed to provide consistency in tone across our site and marketing
            campaigns. After launching the website, we chose new taglines that echoed our previous language but were tonally more appropriate for our messaging.</p>

          <p>In the first full week after the revised site went live, the school received five enrollment inquiries through the website's contact form. This was more inquiries than the previous website had generated in four years, and the website
            contact form has continued to be one of the highest points of contact with the school, generating more than 70% of the total yearly inquiries.</p>

          <h5>Print Advertising</h5>
          <p>After our site went live, I made new reusable print ads, brochures, pamphlets, and signage with this more cohesive brand language and distributed these across events and physical displays in town. I ran our advertising schedule through
            the year by communicating with news outlets across the state and acquiring prominent display areas for physical signs.</p>

          <h5>Networking and Communications</h5>
          <p>I implemented HubSpot as the school's CRM to assist in the goal of legacy enrollment, building an alumni network, and sending timely, professional newsletters to enrolled families and our donor list. We used HubSpot to build templates
            for several monthly mailers to larger Riley community, including families and board members, and to schedule social media posts for a number of special events and promotions. Through HubSpot we were able to build updated mailing lists
            that ensured we were sending newsletters, some of which contained photos of the children, only to those individuals to whom they were relevant. This was a safety concern we had identified, and were able to solve quickly and permanently.
