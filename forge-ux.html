          <h2>Forge Design System</h2>
          <h5>User Experience Designer, Design Systems Team, athenahealth</h5>
          <p>Forge is the internal athenahealth design system, created for high fatigue web interfaces in healthcare. Many healthcare workers spend hours on the same page, so our design focus is on simple, highly accessible interfaces using plain
            language and meeting a WCAG AA level of certification. Forge components are spacious, clean, and use a restrained color palette.</p>

          <p>My role on the Design Systems team is diverse as I am not only designing new components, but am serving as an ambassador to other designers across product groups. My primary goal is to elevate the image of Forge by providing a
            multitude of teams with timely information about Forge and the Design System team's roadmap, while providing support to designers using the product.</p>

          <h5>Key areas for improvement for Forge</h5>
          <p>The design system is relatively new, and has been developer-focused up until this point. Seeing as the system is in its early development stages, there are a few key areas where it can be expanded to be more helpful to designers at the
            company. For instance, while there are code examples provided, the online guide and presentation space has little to no design guidance on using the components. Additionally, designers at the company are often asked to build designs with
            Forge before they have had any experience with it. Without comprehensive materials to support their learning curve, the task becomes increasingly difficult.</p>

          <h5>Problem solving and proposed solution</h5>

          <p>Currently, I am conversing with director-level colleagues to identify what resources the design community at athenahealth needs. To conduct this research, I have gathered quantitative feedback by releasing a survey asking what resources
            the community should have and in what form those resources should be given. Presently, in-person seminars and lessons, a written design guide with specifications and layout rules, and design critiques stand out as gaps in the Forge
            guidance.</p>

          <p>The results of the initial feedback encouraged me to start holding design critiques in place of an underused Forge "office hours" meeting. This change allows designers to present in-progress work to the Design Systems team for feedback
            and advice.</p>

          <p>My future strategy will be to add a section for designers to the existing Forge Design System website that allows for a multitude of functions. It will show sample usage of all components in the design system, house both recorded and
            written guidance on how to use the design assets, include helpful tools for using our Sketch libraries, and have sample page layouts for multiple athenahealth services.</p>

          <p>I am currently designing new components that will be added to the design system's next release. These additional components will ship with designer guidance as well as the standard developer guidance, and as time allows we will add
            similar guidance to the other components.</p>
