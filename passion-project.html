          <h2>Munch</h2>
          <h5>Passion Project</h5>
          <p>While we all love our pets, we can almost all agree that the pet food industry is much less lovable. To combat this, I'm creating Munch, a program designed to provide personalized dog food recommendations to customers based on foods and companies they're already familiar with &mdash; a Goodreads of dog food, if you will. While it exists as a concept at this point in time, I intend to develop it into a viable product.</p>

          <p>In 2017, I worked for a mom-and-pop pet food store, after graduating and coming home from school struggling with several food intolerances of my own. Through that job I learned an extensive amount about pet food quality, and how many pets can have underlying food intolerances similar to ours that can affect their energy, mood, and well being. Knowing firsthand how much of a difference diet changes can make pulled this issue close to my heart, and knowing about the questionable ingredients and nutrition of many popular pet food brands, I feel very strongly that even our pets deserve to eat real foods&mdash; not corn or beet pulp that adds bulk without nutrition. Often, budget is a constraint when seeking a quality pet food diet, and Munch is a service that seeks to pair consumers with choices that fit their lifestyle as well as their price point.</p>

          <p>My goal with Munch is to do the research for you on companies, ingredients, and other other less commonly discussed considerations &mdash; like sustainability and packaging &mdash; to help people make more informed choices about what you provide your pets.</p>

          <h5>Overview</h5>
          <p>This program is intended to be a tool to find and compare the qualities of most commercial dog foods. Given that that's a lot of information to digest (pun fully intended), Munch is a web interface that keeps it simple. Here I show the find-and-compare tool, the core of the program. Foods can be searched by brand or by a set of criteria (price, ingredients, puppy/senior dog formula), and limited by price. The results are shown in context with similar brands ranked by Munch's proprietary rating system &mdash; which can be examined in depth, with reputable sources, in its own page of the site. </p>

          <img src="https://github.com/emilane/emilane.github.io/blob/master/images/browser-mockup.png?raw=true" alt="a homepage design for Munch">

          <p>Under the header is an educational fact or statement in an easy-to-digest blurb, which enforces our core value of customer education. Below that, a menu appears where users will select the number of factors that influence their dog's nutritional needs. Once these have been selected, your position on the rating scale is shown and you have the ability to select the food you're buying and compare it to those higher or lower on the scale. The rating is displayed next to the foods you've chosen to compare, and below your comparison is a blurb about the reasoning behind the rating for each food. </p>

          <p>Using the customer's existing knowledge and opinions of popular brands helps create a relationship between their perceptions of brands and new options they may not have heard of or considered. In an ideal situation, the customer would switch from feeding a low-quality, low-nutritional value, potentially expensive food to one that has superior ingredients and value for the price. In many cases, this food may be less expensive than the popular brand they're currently using&mdash; which results in a win for both the dog and the customer.</p>

          <h5>Marketing</h5>
          <p>The customers we at Munch are trying to attract are 40-and-under, very tech-savvy social media users, so online advertising is crucial to spreading the brand's name. Here I show an example social media post, advancing their core value of education. The image carousels to additional facts about dog kibbles, and stays interesting and trendy in its presentation. </p>
